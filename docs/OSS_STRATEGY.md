## 1. KPI Dashboard

### Current Snapshot (2026-03-06)

| Metric | Value | Signal |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Stars | 0 | No social proof yet |
| Forks | 4 | Interest exists (fork-before-star pattern) |
| Contributors | 2 (kimimgo 82, NikanEidi 1) | Need 3+ external |
| Clones (14d) | 604 total / 137 unique | High — bot or crawler? |
| Views (14d) | 2 / 1 unique | Almost zero organic discovery |
| Referrers | github.com only | No external traffic source |
| Open Issues | 16 (9 good-first-issue) | Healthy backlog |
| Closed Issues | 5 | Low throughput |
| PRs | 1 merged, 1 closed | Contributor pipeline starting |
| PyPI downloads | ~0 | Not yet promoted |
| MCP registries | 0 | Undiscoverable |

### Targets

| Metric | 1-month | 3-month | 6-month |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Stars | 30+ | 100+ | 200+ |
| Forks | 10+ | 25+ | 50+ |
| Contributors | 5+ | 10+ | 20+ |
| PyPI downloads/mo | 200+ | 1,000+ | 5,000+ |
| Views (14d) | 100+ | 500+ | 2,000+ |
| MCP registries | 3+ | 5+ | 5+ |
| JOSS paper | - | submitted | accepted |

### Gap Analysis

**Critical gap**: Views=2 vs Clones=604. 이는 봇/크롤러 클론이거나 직접 링크 접근.
진짜 사용자는 거의 없다. **발견 가능성(discoverability)이 #1 병목**.

|--------|---------|----------------|--------|
| MCP Registry: Smithery.ai | Registry | High — MCP users browse here | `smithery.yaml` ready |
| MCP Registry: awesome-mcp-servers | GitHub | High — 8k+ stars list | PR to submit |
| MCP Registry: Glama.ai | Registry | Medium | Profile to create |
| MCP Registry: mcp.run | Registry | Medium | Submit |
| MCP Registry: Anthropic | Registry | High — official | Apply |
| GitHub Topics | Search | 15 topics set | Done |
| PyPI keywords | Search | Set in pyproject.toml | Done |
| GitHub description | Search | Updated | Done |

### Phase B: Community Launch (Week 2-3)

## 5. Branding

### Identity

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Name | **parapilot** |
| Tagline | "Headless CAE post-processing for AI assistants" |
| One-liner | "Ask your AI to render your simulation" |
| Accent | `#00d4ff` |
| Dark BG | `#0a0a0a` |
| Font body | Inter |
| Font code | JetBrains Mono |
| Tone | Technical, confident, concise. Zero hype. |

### Positioning Matrix

```
                    GUI Required
                    ↑
     ParaView       |       Kitware VTK-MCP
     (full IDE)     |       (docs only)
                    |
  ←──────────────── + ──────────────────→
   Few tools        |              Many tools
                    |
     LLNL           |       parapilot
     paraview_mcp   |       (headless, 18 tools,
     (GUI-attached) |        934 tests, plugin)
                    |
                    ↓
                    Headless
```

**We own the bottom-right quadrant**: headless + many tools + tested.

### What We Are

> The only headless scientific visualization server that speaks MCP.
> Zero GUI, zero boilerplate — just ask your AI to render your simulation.

### What We Are NOT

- Not a ParaView replacement (we complement it)
- Not a complete CAE platform
- Not a simulation solver/runner
- Not "AI that understands physics" (we render, not simulate)

### Messaging by Audience

| Audience | Hook | Proof Point |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **CFD Engineers** | "Render your OpenFOAM/CGNS with a single prompt" | DrivAerML 8.8M cell demo |
| **AI Developers** | "Give your LLM eyes for simulation data" | 18 tools, Claude plugin, stdio/SSE |
| **Researchers** | "Reproducible viz pipelines in version control" | JSON DSL, deterministic output |
| **OSS Contributors** | "Well-tested, well-documented, real impact" | 934 tests, 97% coverage, 9 good-first-issues |
| **Engineering Managers** | "Automate post-processing in CI/CD" | Docker GPU, batch_render, headless |

### Visual Assets Needed

| Asset | Spec | Status | Issue |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Logo (SVG) | Wireframe mesh + pilot motif, `#00d4ff` → `#0066ff` gradient | Not started | #23 |

## 6. Contributor Growth Strategy

### Current Pipeline

```
Discovery: Views=2 ← BOTTLENECK
  ↓
Interest: Forks=4, Clones=604
  ↓
First Contact: Issues opened=21, Comments on issues
  ↓
First PR: 1 merged (NikanEidi), 1 assigned (Darshankg18)
  ↓
Repeat: 0 repeat contributors
```

### Tactics

#### A. Good First Issue Pipeline (always 5-8 open)

| Colormaps/presets | 2 (#6, #15) | 1-2 |
| Features | 1 (#9) | 1 |
| **Total** | **11** | **5-8** |

**Rule**: When one is closed, open a new one within 48h.

#### B. Issue Quality Standards

Every issue must have:
- `## Summary` — what and why
- `## What to do` — step-by-step instructions
- `## Files to modify` — exact file paths
- `## Difficulty` — Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
- Labels: `good first issue` + category + `help wanted`

#### C. Recognition Ladder

## 7. Competitive Moat

Things competitors cannot easily replicate:

| Moat | Why It's Defensible |
|------|-------------------|
| **934 tests** | Months of work; LLNL/paraview_mcp has 0 |
| **Pipeline DSL** | Declarative JSON filter chains + code gen |
| **Physics-aware defaults** | Field name → physical quantity auto-detection |
| **Split-pane animation** | Synchronized multi-view + time-series graph GIF |
| **Dual execution** | Local VTK + Docker GPU seamless switching |
| **Claude Code plugin** | One-line install: `claude install kimimgo/parapilot` |
| **Cinematic renderer** | PCA auto-camera + 3-point lighting + SSAO + PBR |

---

## 8. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| ParaView adds native MCP | Medium | High | Focus on headless + CI/CD differentiator |
| VTK breaking change | Low | Medium | Pin VTK version, test matrix |
| Zero traction after launch | Medium | High | Iterate on messaging, try different channels |
| Sole maintainer burnout | High | Critical | Build contributor base, automate everything |
| Security vulnerability | Low | High | CodeQL, Dependabot, minimal attack surface |
